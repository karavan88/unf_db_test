    "The bar chart presents a snapshot of the relationship between maternal health indicators, such as  Skilled birth attendant and Antenatal care (4+ visits) for women aged 15-49 years worldwide based on household survey data in the range of 2018-2022. It plots the calculated population weighted averages for these indicators by the SDG progress status of Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR), represented by the categories \"Achieved\", \"On Track\" and \"Acceleration Needed\". The overall findings indeed suggest association between the maternal health indicators and the U5MR status. However, not everywhere these relartionships are statistically significant. Nonetheless, the overall pattern allows for concluding that countries with the higher shares of skilled birth attendants and antenatal care visits tend to have lower U5MR rates, i.e., countries that have achieved targets in under-five mortality exhibit significatly higher rates of skill birth attendance and antenatal care. While the current analysis does not allow for making causal claims, it does suggest that maternal health indicators are important for achieving the under-five mortality target.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the particular focus of this task refers to the distinction between \"acceleration needed\" (i.e., off track) and \"on track\"categories. Although for the indicator of \"Antenatal care 4+ visits,\" countries in the \"On Track\" (56.5%) exhibit higher coverage than in \"Acceleration Needed\" (54.4%), the difference is not significant as the confidence intervals overlap. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, quite a different pattern is observed when it comes to the \"Skilled birth attendant\" indicator Countries that are \"On Track\" have a mean coverage of 85.7%, while those requiring \"Acceleration\" lag behind at 63.8%. As the confidence intervals do not overrlap, these differences are statistically significant. This potentially suggests that the \"Skilled birth attendant\" indicator is more related to achieving the U5MR target than the \"Antenatal care 4+ visits\" indicator.However, as has been mentioned previousely, in order to make a well-grounded policy recommendation, further research is needed to establish the causal relationship between these indicators and U5MR."
